Re: MRI safety training renewalHi Tom, 
 
Apologies for the delay in our reply, I have been trying to find someone to deliver some ad hoc training for you. 
 
Beatriz (cc-ed) has kindly said she can deliver this for you. Could you liaise with her to find a suitable date where you can fit in a Teams call to complete the refresher training?
 
Thanks
 
Caitlin

Hello,
 
I’m a clinical research fellow, working in fetal cardiac MRI.
I’ve received a notification informing me that I need to renew my MRI safety training in late Feb / March 2024.
 
Unfortunately, the slots clash with the MRI scans which I need to cover, so I cannot do both.
Is it possible to review the safety training video at a different time?
 
Regards,
 Tom
