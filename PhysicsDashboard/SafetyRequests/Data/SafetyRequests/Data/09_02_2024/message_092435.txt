Hi David,  I believe we’ve missed one of our scanners off of these service key updates. Would you please be able to pass on the key for the Evelina Vida serial No. 176175?  Many Thanks  Jamie Small  GSTT MR Physics

Hi David, 
 
Thanks so much for the service keys! It is much appreciated
 
Would it be possible to resend the service key for the Avanto Fit (169610)? I think this one was missed off (.dat file is for 141028 instead of 169610)
 
Many thanks for your help, 
Liz

Dear Siemens/David,
 
Our L4 Service Keys at GSTT have now expired. Please can you issue new Level 4 service keys for the systems listed in the email below, including 006-MR00053790, for which we don’t have a key anymore following a software upgrade? 
 
Many thanks,

Hi David,
 
Just to follow up on this email from Alan in our team. Please could we get the L4 service keys for our GSTT scanners.
 
Additionally a software upgrade was recently one on 006-MR00053790 which we don’t have the key for anymore.
 
Thanks
Simon

Also, I have a query about the Avanto Fit in this list. On going to options, service, local service this morning I got the following service key request (see attached photo). 
￼
 
 
Is this the correct screen for entering the level 4 service key? I could not get it to work…
Thanks for the help and the service keys

Hi David,
 
I appear to be having trouble tracking down our Level 4 service key for the recently installed Vida:
System ID 006-MR00072750; Serial Number 176584
 
Would you possibly mind re-sending it to us?

Good for you.
 
Please let us know when you’re back on generating annual keys. If doesn’t come through before 28th Oct, could we bother you for another 30 day set?
 
Any thoughts on the level 3 keys? Out of interest are you able to share what the difference is between the different levels?
 
Cheers
Geoff

Hi Geoff, 
 
Yes – there was a change to our licensing tool privileges which meant we could only generate 30 day keys, albeit for any system. 
I’m having mine put back to what it was so that I can generate annual keys.

Thanks David.
 
Appears the 2 additional systems that you attached .dat files for are level 3 only? 
 
Will you be able to generate keys for a year in the coming weeks?
 
Thanks again
Geoff

Hi David
 
Hope you and family managing to stay well in sunny Sheffield.
 
It is that time of year again. Are you happy to run through the list and generate some more L4 keys for us please before Oct?
 
The first two on the list below (006-MR0010691 and 006-MR0010689 no longer exist, so can ignore these)
 
However, please can you add 2 new systems to the list… 
006-MR00063790, 142391
006-MR00057760, 142364
 
Many thanks
