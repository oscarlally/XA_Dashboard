RE: Off label risk assessment Dear Juliet
Thank you for the prompt response.
I will respond in my capacity as a consultant paediatric cardiologist and CMR consultant.
The concern is that the liver function is compromised as a sign of Fontan associated liver disease
The cardiac MRI will give us the functional cardiovascular  haemodynamic information (flows and function) of the state of the Fontan that CT alone cannot provide.
Liver MRI is also superior to USS in this domain and will give us more information to aid clinical decision making
This is not super urgent, but would be good to come a decision within a couple of weeks if possible

Dear Kuberan, 
I can have a look into this for you - what is the clinical indication for the scans?
We need a consultant cardiologist or radiologist to confirm that no other imaging modality will answer the clinical question and that the request is warranted before we can start the off-label process. Are you happy to confirm this for us?
How urgently would they like to scan, if that is the decision that is taken?
Many thanks, 
Juliet

Dear Team
Please can you help with this request from RBHT site
Patient has a Medtronic CapsureFix lead not attached to the box and the distal end of the lead is in the abdomen
This will therefore be off label.
The clinicians would like us to do a cardiac MRi and a liver MRI
Risk assessment will help us work out what is feasible. 
The email trail below sheds some light on the ask and I have attached details of the implanted lead to this email.
Happy to chat in person if needed. Sylvia Krupickova is the paediatric CMR lead at the RBHT site and in cc.
If deemed suitable the patient can be scanned at either site.

Dear Kuberan,
We wonder if you can express your opinion on patient Sophia Rodriguez  who is a failing Fontan and needs heart and liver MRI.
In the past we were very reserved to scan this patient due to pacemaker lead being coiled around the bottom of her heart with the other end being freely in the abdomen.
Alain discussed her at MDM at Evelina recently and the team apparently agreed that MRI of this patient can be done safely. Following this, Alain spoke with the parents and they are awaiting MRI dates.
I was not present at that MDM. I now discussed with my adult colleagues who scan patients with pacemakers every week (cc’ed) and there is still reservation to scan her given her lead and small age/weight.
Alain asked me to reach out to you for your opinion as he thinks he or James Wong might have been there at the time of discussion.

Would you be so kind and let us know if you have experience with such paediatric patients and if you are scanning them?
Your view would be much appreciated.
Her MDM form is on EPIC, I am unable to attach it here, but the Xray is below.

Thank you.
